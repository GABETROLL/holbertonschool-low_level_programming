# Learning Recusrion in C, with Holberton
## Files

``_putchar``: ``putchar`` function recreation, provided by Holberton. It's meant to replace ``putchar`` from ``stdio.h``, because we're meant to learn problem-solving, and not use the built-ins.
## Examples:
0-2: Use recursion to simulate a for loop on a string
3-5: Use recursion to simulate a for loop for calculating an int
