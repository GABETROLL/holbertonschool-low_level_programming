# Exercises of Nested For-Loops and Other Functions.
In this folder, we made the header file named ``main.h`` that contains the functions we are using.

We can only use ``_putchar``, instead of any builtin C functions. Holberton provided ``_putchar`` in [\_putchar.c/\_putchar.c](https://github.com/hs-hq/_putchar.c/blob/main/_putchar.c), which I copied and pasted into ``_putchar.c``.
